        <b>They chose the green passage and entered.</b> As soon as they entered a sudden magical voice was heard in the narrow passage. They walked further and further and heard at every step a louder eco of the microscopical voice. They arrived at the end of the narrow passage and found loads of little fairies that started to transport them far away from the end of the passage. These fairies seemed kind and gentle but all of a sudden these fairies left them fall in the middle of a big hole. They fairies rejected out of the cave and sent to the start again.</p>
