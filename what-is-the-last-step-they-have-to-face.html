    <h1>What is the last step they have to face?</h1>
   <p>
     <b>All of a sudden</b>  the lemur changed position and moved the sticks around and said: “ No, stop I think what I said is wrong, go to the wise giraffe near the village, she lives in a straw tent near the center of the village. Go to her and ask for the millitro that is a purple flower you have to throw in the pond and as I said before drink form it”. The three animals thanked the lemur and ran as fast as possible to the tent of the giraffe. She was doing a yoga position saying something mysterious in an ancient language. 
    As they entered she slowly opened her eyes and made them enter in her house. She said she knew the lemur and he did the right chose to send them to her. She said she was going to give the millitro to them only if they could answer her question: “ What is the most important thing between all of you?”.
    It took them a lot of time to think until Musù said with a low voice:” FRIENDSHIP “.
    It was the correct answer so she handed them the millitro.
    They reached the pond followed the instructions of the lemur and came back to normal!
