    <h1>The Mysterious Flower</h1>
    <p>Manny, Mus√π and Jenny decided to go to the old sticky cave of the village because they knew it was magic. They entered the cave because there was a mysterious flower that gave answers to every question. But old stories said it was very difficult to find it nearly nobody could arrive at the flower.
        They entered the narrow passage and it took nearly two hours to reach the end of the cave and arrived at a crossroad from where spooky voices came out. There were two passages: a stone passage with green stones outside from were loud screams came form and another one with grey and red stone from were spooky voices came from.</p>
